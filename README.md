# Terminal Subnetting Assistant

A terminal-style React web app designed to assist students and network engineers with IPv4 subnetting â€” both **Normal Subnetting** and **VLSM** (Variable Length Subnet Masking). The app features a command-line interface, subnet calculation outputs, and a sidebar with helpful commands and history.

## Features

- Terminal-like command input supporting:
  - `ipv4 net n [ip]/[prefix] [count]` for Normal subnetting
  - `ipv4 net vlsm [ip]/[prefix] [hosts...]` for VLSM subnetting
- Real-time output of subnet details:
  - Network address, first/last usable IP, broadcast, prefix, subnet mask
- Summary table for Normal subnetting showing:
  - Bits borrowed, bits left, total IPs, usable IPs
- Command history and help accessible via commands and sidebar
- Keyboard support for cycling through previous commands (arrow keys)
- Clean UI styled with TailwindCSS, responsive design
